# Microcontroller Based EMG Measurement in Servo System (UNI Project)
A project that utilizes the PIC18F87K22 microcontroller to measure electromyography (EMG) signals. 
It integrates EMG Click modules for capturing muscle activity and controls a servo motor in real-time based on processed EMG data. Includes algorithms for signal processing and system validation.
